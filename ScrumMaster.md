# Update Task to Scrum Master

## Aim
We want to share the daily tasks list to scrum master with the ETA. Task is fairly simple but we have to somehow manage the meta-data for the ETA

## Requirement
 - Tasks File
 - URL

## Steps
It is fairly similar to Daily Checkins one
 - First we have to goto the url which will be in the env
 - Then we have to load the file containing the tasks
 - We have to type the content of the tasks file as it is
 - Then have to leave that operation as User may want to change the tasks.
 - Also ETA will be given by the user himself
